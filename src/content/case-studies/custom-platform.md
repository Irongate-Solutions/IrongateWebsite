## Challenge
A specialty manufacturer tracked production, inventory, and quality control across multiple facilities using Excel spreadsheets and email. Order processing took 3-4 days, quality issues weren't detected until final inspection, and inventory accuracy sat at 78%.

## Solution
Built a custom web-based operations platform tailored to their specific manufacturing workflow. Integrated with existing machinery via REST APIs and MQTT for real-time production data. Implemented barcode scanning for inventory tracking and quality checkpoints throughout the production line.

## Technical Implementation
- React frontend with real-time WebSocket updates
- Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database
- MQTT integration for IoT machine sensors
- Custom reporting engine for production metrics
- Mobile-responsive interface for shop floor use

## Outcome
- Reduced order processing time from 3-4 days to 4-6 hours (60% faster)
- Improved inventory accuracy from 78% to 99.1%
- Detected quality issues 3-5 stages earlier in production
- Increased production throughput by 23% with same workforce
- ROI achieved in 7 months

## Technologies
React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, MQTT, Docker, AWS EC2, Nginx
