## Challenge
A top-ranked food manufacturer needed to build capacity for handling increasingly complex customer requirements before those demands became operational bottlenecks. While existing processes worked for current volume, leadership recognized that high-value customers and prospective clients required more granular control than their systems could support. Customer A needed specific allergen labeling on certain products but not others. Customer B required different lot tracking methods depending on the destination state. Customer C's requirements changed based on whether the order was for retail or food service. The operations team lacked tools to handle requirements at this level of detail. Without proactive investment in a flexible system, the company risked losing key accounts and limiting future growth. Configuration mistakes were already costly, and implementing requirement changes took hours as staff manually identified which specific orders were affected. The business needed a solution that would enable them to compete for and retain customers with sophisticated requirements.

## Solution
Developed a rules engine that operates at multiple levels of granularity simultaneously. System integrates with the ERP to pull purchase order data and applies the most specific rule that matches each order's characteristics. A customer might have baseline requirements, but specific products trigger additional rules, and individual purchase orders can override everything when needed. Operations staff see exactly which rules apply to the order in front of them without needing to remember special cases or consult reference materials. A maintenance screen allows authorized users to adjust rules for active orders up until shipping, handling last-minute customer pivots without disrupting production flow.

## Technical Implementation
The platform maintains a hierarchical rules structure where customer-level requirements serve as defaults, product categories add specialized rules, and individual purchase orders can override any setting. Integration layer connects to the ERP system, pulling order details and pushing completion status back in real-time. Rule builder lets account managers configure requirements without technical knowledge, using dropdown menus and conditional logic. The maintenance interface displays all in-progress orders with their current rule assignments, allowing instant modifications that propagate immediately to production stations. Validation engine checks for conflicting rules and alerts staff when requirements can't be satisfied simultaneously. Audit trail captures every rule application and modification with timestamp and operator confirmation for compliance documentation.

## Outcome
- Enabled the company to secure and retain key customers with complex requirements
- Eliminated configuration errors causing shipment rejections (from 9-12 per month to almost zero)
- Reduced rework costs from $23,000 monthly to under $2,000
- Cut implementation time of requirement changesfrom hours to less than 5 minutes
- Handled hundreds of last-minute requirement changes in first year without delaying shipments
- Positioned the manufacturer as a preferred supplier capable of managing sophisticated customer demands
