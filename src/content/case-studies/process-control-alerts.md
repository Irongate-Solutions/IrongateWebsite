## Challenge
A manufacturing facility experienced equipment failures that escalated from minor issues to production shutdowns. Leaky valves, pressure anomalies, and temperature deviations went unnoticed for hours until operators completed routine checks. By the time maintenance crews arrived, minor problems had escalated into major headaches. The facility averaged 8-12 escalated equipment failures monthly, and emergency response time from issue detection to technician arrival ranged from 2-4 hours.

## Solution
Built a real-time alert system integrated with the facility's process control network that monitors equipment states continuously. Operators can configure alert triggers based on threshold values, rate of change, or specific equipment state combinations. When conditions are met, the system immediately notifies relevant personnel through multiple channels and creates a timestamped incident record. Maintenance teams receive alerts with equipment location, historical performance data, and suggested troubleshooting steps.

## Technical Implementation
The platform connects directly to existing programmable logic controllers and SCADA systems to pull live process data. Alert rules engine evaluates conditions every few seconds and routes notifications based on severity level and on-call schedules. Mobile interface gives maintenance staff instant access to real-time equipment metrics and historical trends at the point of failure. Dashboard displays facility-wide equipment health status and tracks mean time between failures for predictive maintenance planning.

## Outcome
- Reduced equipment failure response time
- Cut escalated failures from 8-12 per month to 1-2 per month
- Maintenance team can now address 6-8 issues daily that previously would have escalated overnight
