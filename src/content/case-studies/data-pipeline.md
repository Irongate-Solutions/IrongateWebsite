## Challenge
An e-commerce platform relied on nightly batch reports that were often 24-48 hours old. Marketing campaigns were optimized on stale data, inventory decisions lagged demand signals, and customer service lacked visibility into real-time order status.

## Solution
Architected and deployed a streaming analytics pipeline that ingests data from 12 different sources (web, mobile app, warehouse systems, payment processors) and delivers insights with sub-minute latency. Built custom dashboards for different teams with role-specific metrics and drill-down capabilities.

## Technical Implementation
- Apache Kafka for event streaming (processing 2M+ events/day)
- Apache Spark for real-time aggregations
- Snowflake data warehouse for historical analysis
- Custom React dashboards with live data updates
- dbt for data transformation and modeling

## Outcome
- Reduced data freshness from 24+ hours to under 60 seconds
- Enabled real-time campaign optimization (15% improvement in ROAS)
- Decreased stockouts by 34% through predictive inventory alerts
- Improved customer service resolution time by 28%
- Identified and fixed revenue-impacting bugs within minutes instead of days

## Technologies
Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Snowflake, dbt, React, Python, AWS (Kinesis, Lambda, S3), Looker
