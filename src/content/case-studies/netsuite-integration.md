## Challenge
A food manufacturer evaluated NetSuite for financial management and inventory visibility, but initial conversations with their implementation vendor revealed a fundamental conflict. The vendor's approach required rebuilding production planning workflows, recipe management, and quality control processes to fit NetSuite's standard modules. These weren't cosmetic changes; production staff would need to abandon procedures refined over years of operation. The manufacturer faced the decision: force production teams onto unfamiliar workflows in a regulated industry where process deviations create compliance risk, or walk away from NetSuite's financial capabilities. Neither option worked.

## Solution
We built a bidirectional integration layer that separates financial operations from production operations. NetSuite became the system of record for financials, purchasing, while existing systems continued handling production planning, recipe formulation, and quality workflows. The integration synchronizes data between systems automatically, allowing production orders, material consumption, finished goods, and costs to flow into NetSuite without production staff changing their daily routines. Financial data and inventory positions flow back to production systems for planning purposes. The manufacturer gained NetSuite's financial capabilities without disrupting the operations that generate revenue.

## Technical Approach
The integration monitors production systems for completed batches, material usage, and quality releases. These events trigger transformation into NetSuite's transaction formatâ€”work orders, inventory adjustments, and cost postings. Real-time inventory synchronization ensures production planners see accurate material availability without logging into NetSuite. When purchasing receives materials in NetSuite, that availability immediately reflects in production planning tools. Data validation prevents recipe errors or unit-of-measure mismatches from crossing system boundaries. The platform includes reconciliation checks that flag when systems diverge, with detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## Outcome
The manufacturer completed their NetSuite deployment in six months while maintaining production continuity. Finance gained consolidated reporting and real-time inventory visibility across multiple departments. Production teams avoided retraining and process disruption during a critical production season. The existing implementation vendor completed the core NetSuite configuration while we handled the integration complexity they couldn't solve. The manufacturer now operates NetSuite as their financial platform without sacrificing the specialized production workflows that ensure product quality and regulatory compliance.
