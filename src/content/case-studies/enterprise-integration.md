## Challenge
A regional healthcare network operated seven different systems across their facilities: separate EMR systems, billing platforms, and inventory management tools. Data reconciliation required 40+ hours weekly of manual work, with frequent errors impacting billing accuracy.

## Solution
Designed and implemented a centralized integration hub using Apache Kafka for message streaming and custom Python services for data transformation. Built standardized APIs for each legacy system, enabling real-time data synchronization while maintaining HIPAA compliance throughout.

## Technical Implementation
- Deployed Kafka cluster with 99.99% uptime SLA
- Created 23 custom data transformation pipelines
- Implemented HL7 FHIR standard for healthcare data exchange
- Built monitoring dashboard with Grafana for real-time system health

## Outcome
- Reduced manual data entry by 95% (from 40 hours to 2 hours weekly)
- Improved billing accuracy from 87% to 99.3%
- Decreased patient record retrieval time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds
- Saved $1.2M annually in operational costs

## Technologies
PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, HL7 FHIR, Redis, Grafana
