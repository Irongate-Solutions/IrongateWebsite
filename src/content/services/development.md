## When Off-the-Shelf Falls Short
Standard software platforms serve 80% of use cases well. We build solutions for the other 20%â€”the unique workflows, domain-specific requirements, and competitive differentiators that define your business.

## Our Approach
We don't rebuild what already exists. We identify gaps in your current stack and build targeted solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing tools while providing the specific functionality you need.

## What We Build
- Custom internal tools and dashboards
- Industry-specific workflow automation
- API layers for legacy system modernization
- Specialized data processing pipelines
- Integration middleware for complex ecosystems

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js, Go, .NET Core
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Svelte
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP
